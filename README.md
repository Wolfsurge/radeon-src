# Radeon Client
The absolute *worst* client to ever exist.
Skids from many clients.

Here's why my name is in some of the code:

One of the "devs" asked me if I wanted to help develop 
a paid client with them, however they did not tell me it 
was FutureX (Radeon's previous name, before ExVision).
They said they would pay me some money (well that never happened) to rewrite the base
and GUI, and then asked me to skid a bunch of modules from 
other clients.

I have asked them to not use my code or credit me, but they
didn't do either, so yeah I'm putting the code here :P
